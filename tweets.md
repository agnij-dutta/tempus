# Tweets About Building Tempus

## Tweet 1: The Problem
Just built an ephemeral preview environment system because I'm tired of waking up to AWS bills that look like phone numbers. My preview environments now have a built-in self-destruct button. 🚀💰

## Tweet 2: Architecture Humor
My architecture: ECS creates it, DynamoDB remembers it, EventBridge schedules its death, Lambda kills it. It's like a digital version of "The Prestige" but for cloud infrastructure. 🎩✨

## Tweet 3: The Idea
Built a system where preview environments automatically delete themselves after X hours. It's like Cinderella but for containers - they turn into pumpkins (get deleted) at midnight. 🎃⏰

## Tweet 4: Why I Built It
"Why did you build this?" Because I once left a preview environment running for 3 months and AWS sent me a bill that could've bought a small car. Now my infrastructure has abandonment issues. 😅💸

## Tweet 5: Tech Stack Reality
Me: "I'll use Terraform, ECS Fargate, ALB, DynamoDB, Lambda, and EventBridge"
Also me: *spends 2 hours debugging why target group names can't end with a dash*
The cloud is fun! ☁️😭

## Bonus Tweet: The Realization
Just realized my preview environments have better life management than I do. They know exactly when to disappear, have automatic cleanup, and never overstay their welcome. Can I get that as a feature? 🤔
